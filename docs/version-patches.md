# Version-Specific Configuration Patches

The Temporal Worker Controller supports version-specific configuration overrides through the `TemporalWorkerDeploymentPatch` custom resource. This allows fine-grained control over individual worker deployment versions without modifying the main `TemporalWorkerDeployment` resource.

## Overview

Version patches enable you to:

- **Scale specific versions independently**: Adjust replica counts for individual versions based on their workload or importance
- **Customize sunset strategies per version**: Apply different cleanup policies to versions based on their lifecycle needs
- **Maintain operational flexibility**: Make per-version adjustments without affecting the overall deployment strategy

## Use Cases

### 1. Scaling Down Deprecated Versions

When a version is deprecated but still processing workflows, you might want to reduce its resource consumption:

```yaml
apiVersion: temporal.io/v1alpha1
kind: TemporalWorkerDeploymentPatch
metadata:
  name: scale-down-deprecated-v1
spec:
  temporalWorkerDeploymentName: my-worker-deployment
  versionID: "my-worker-deployment.v1.0.0"
  replicas: 1  # Reduce from default 3 to 1
  sunsetStrategy:
    scaledownDelay: 30m  # Faster scaledown
    deleteDelay: 2h      # Quicker cleanup
```

### 2. Scaling Up Critical Versions

For versions handling critical workflows that require higher availability:

```yaml
apiVersion: temporal.io/v1alpha1
kind: TemporalWorkerDeploymentPatch
metadata:
  name: scale-up-critical-v2
spec:
  temporalWorkerDeploymentName: my-worker-deployment
  versionID: "my-worker-deployment.v2.1.0"
  replicas: 10  # Increase from default 3 to 10
  sunsetStrategy:
    scaledownDelay: 24h  # Keep running longer
    deleteDelay: 7d      # Preserve for a week
```

## Patch Status

The controller automatically updates patch status to indicate whether patches are successfully applied:

### Status Types

- **Active**: The patch is applied to an existing version
- **Orphaned**: The referenced version no longer exists
- **Invalid**: The referenced TemporalWorkerDeployment doesn't exist

### Status Fields

```yaml
status:
  status: Active
  appliedAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  observedGeneration: 1
```

## Controller Behavior

### Reconciliation

1. **Patch Discovery**: The controller watches for changes to `TemporalWorkerDeploymentPatch` resources
2. **Status Updates**: Patch statuses are updated during each reconciliation loop
3. **Continuous Application**: During every reconciliation, patches are applied to compute effective configuration for all operations
4. **Event Propagation**: Changes to patches trigger reconciliation of the target `TemporalWorkerDeployment`

### How Patches Are Applied

Patches are applied **continuously during each reconciliation loop**, affecting:

- **Scaling Operations**: Existing deployments are scaled immediately when patch replica counts differ from current state
- **Sunset Decisions**: Patch sunset strategies are used to determine when to scale down and delete deployments
- **New Deployment Creation**: When new deployments are created, they use the effective configuration including patches

The controller actively monitors the difference between current deployment state and the effective configuration (including patches) and takes action to reconcile any differences.

### Conflict Resolution

- If multiple patches target the same version and field, the last applied patch wins
- Patches are applied in alphabetical order by name for deterministic behavior
- Invalid patches are marked as such and do not affect deployment behavior

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose and target:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: scale-down-v1-deprecated
  # or
  name: extend-sunset-critical-v2
```

### Lifecycle Management

1. **Create patches proactively** for versions you know will need special handling
2. **Monitor patch statuses** to identify orphaned patches that can be cleaned up
3. **Use labels** to group related patches for easier management:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    temporal.io/version-class: deprecated
    temporal.io/scaling-policy: conservative
```

### Resource Management

- **Clean up orphaned patches** regularly to avoid resource accumulation
- **Co-locate patches** with their target deployments in the same namespace
- **Set appropriate RBAC** to control who can create/modify patches

## Limitations

1. **Namespace Scope**: Patches must be in the same namespace as their target `TemporalWorkerDeployment`
2. **Supported Fields**: Currently only `replicas` and `sunsetStrategy` fields can be overridden
3. **Version Scope**: Patches apply to specific version IDs, not version patterns
4. **Immediate Effect**: Patch changes take effect during the next reconciliation loop (typically within 10 seconds)

## Monitoring

### Kubectl Commands

```bash
# List all patches
kubectl get temporalworkerdeploymentpatches

# Show patch details
kubectl describe twdpatch scale-down-old-version

# Check patch status
kubectl get twdpatch -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.status,VERSION:.spec.versionID
```

### Metrics

The controller provides metrics for:
- Number of active/orphaned/invalid patches
- Patch application success/failure rates
- Time since last patch status update

This enables monitoring and alerting on patch health and effectiveness.
